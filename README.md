## Work Completed
I began this project with starter code that provided the basic framework and environment setup. This included pre-defined functions, data structures, and scaffolding to help me focus on the core logic rather than boilerplate.  

From there, I created my own code to implement the main functionality. I wrote custom algorithms, debugged runtime errors, refined logic for efficiency, and added new modules where necessary. My contributions involved both extending the given code and building original solutions to meet the project requirements.

## Connecting Learning to Computer Science
Throughout this course, I learned how computer science is not just about writing code—it’s about solving problems systematically. Computer scientists design algorithms, build systems, and analyze data to improve processes across industries. Their work matters because it drives innovation, enables automation, and creates tools that shape how society functions.

## My Problem-Solving Approach
When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I:
- Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts  
- Use abstraction to focus on essential details  
- Prototype quickly, then iterate through testing and debugging  
- Document my work clearly for reproducibility and collaboration  
- Balance efficiency with clarity, aiming for solutions that are both elegant and practical

## Ethical Responsibilities
I recognize that my work carries ethical responsibilities:
- **To the end user:** Ensure systems are safe, accessible, and fair. Protect privacy and avoid bias in algorithms.  
- **To the organization:** Write secure, maintainable code that aligns with organizational goals while upholding integrity.  
- **To society:** Consider the broader impact of technology, ensuring that my contributions empower communities rather than reinforce inequality.
